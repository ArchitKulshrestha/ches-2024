        At ChES, we are proud to curate a diverse calendar of events that ignite
        the enthusiasm for chemical engineering and nurture an innovative

        activities, with flagship events such as SIPHON, ALCHEMY, and EUREKA
        taking center stage. The remaining year is filled with workshops,
        industrial visits, Chem-E-Car Competitions, and numerous K-12
        activities.
